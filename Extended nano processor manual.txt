MANUAL FOR EXTENDED NANO PROCESSOR

The programming process begins by toggling the Program_mode button (bottom button) to enter Program Mode. If needed, the ROM_reset button (top button) can be
pressed to clear all contents in the Program_ROM. The user then sets a 13-bit instruction
using the 13 rightmost DIP switches. Once the instruction is configured, it is loaded
into the current ROM address by pressing the load_instruction button (left button).
The NextROM button (right button) is used to increment the ROM address, allowing the
user to program the next instruction. After all desired instructions have been entered,
pressing the Program_mode button again exits Program Mode and returns the system
to normal execution.
